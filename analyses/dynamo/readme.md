# Forma Dynamo template extension

**Note: This extension is a tech preview and the runnin Dynamo in Forma will (for now) only run on Autodesk VPN. You can use this from anywhere to start experimenting on Forma data in Dynamo**

This extension includes a Dynamo template which is hooked up data extraction and visualization in Forma.
With the extension you and configure and export a template, modify it in Dynamo for Revit, reimport it into the extension and run it in Dynamo in Forma. You can also follow only the first two steps, as we bundle the current data into the dynamo template. And you can then use Dynamo for Revit to expore the data in Dynamo.
